    "    ---\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 🧠 Step-by-Step Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Extract Action Candidates:**\n",
    "    - Carefully read the problem statement and highlight all phrases or sentences involving **verbs** that indicate actions performed by users, systems, or external actors.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Analyze Each Candidate:**\n",
    "    - For each verb or verb phrase, ask:\n",
    "        - Is this a meaningful system interaction or behavior?\n",
    "        - Does it result in a **state change** or **data processing**?\n",
    "        - Is this relevant to the core flow of the system?\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Refine and Normalize Actions:**\n",
    "    - Convert each valid action to **camelCase**.\n",
    "    - Discard vague or generic verbs like “handle,” “process,” unless used in a well-defined context.\n",
    "    - Merge similar or redundant actions into a single representative form.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **Validate Coverage and Completeness:**\n",
    "    - Re-read the problem statement to ensure no important action is missing.\n",
    "    - Double-check if the identified actions represent **all user and system behaviors** that are essential to the system flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 🧾 Intermediate Reasoning Output (Example Format):\n",
    "    Write the reasoning for **each action** like this before outputting JSON:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - \"registerUser\": derived from \"The user fills out a form and submits it to register an account\"\n",
    "    - \"verifyEmail\": derived from \"The system sends a verification link to the user's email\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    (Do this for each identified action to explain how you derived it.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### ✅ Final Output Format (Strict JSON Only):\n",
    "    After your reasoning, output valid JSON in this format (on a new line):\n",
    "\n",

    "    ---\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 🧠 Step-by-Step Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Analyze Actions Sequentially:**\n",
    "    - Think about the natural flow of the system.\n",
    "    - Identify which action marks the **starting point** of the process.\n",
    "    - Determine which actions represent decisions, parallel flows, or endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Map Each Action to a Node Type:**\n",
    "    - Action that starts the flow → **Initial Node**.\n",
    "    - Regular process or task → **Action Node**.\n",
    "    - Choice or condition → **Decision Node**.\n",
    "    - Merging alternate paths → **Merge Node**.\n",
    "    - Parallel task initiation → **Fork Node**.\n",
    "    - Parallel task synchronization → **Join Node**.\n",
    "    - End of process → **Final Node**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Assign Meaningful Names:**\n",
    "    - Use meaningful and concise camelCase names for node `name` values.\n",
    "    - Ensure they clearly describe what happens at each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **Ensure Diagram Completeness:**\n",
    "    - Include at least: 1 Initial Node, 1 Final Node.\n",
    "    - All critical actions should be represented as nodes.\n",
    "    - Include control nodes where logical branching or parallelism occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### ✨ Reasoning Example:\n",
    "    - \"selectTicketType\" → Action Node: basic interaction.\n",
    "    - \"choosePaymentMethod\" → Decision Node: user selects between methods.\n",
    "    - \"processCashPayment\" and \"processCardPayment\" → Action Nodes, may follow a Fork or Decision.\n",
    "    - \"printTicket\" → likely comes near the end.\n",
    "    - \"displayErrorMessage\" → may be downstream of a Decision Node for failure cases.\n",
    "    (Do this for each action before JSON output.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    ---\n",

    "    5. **Parallelism (Optional):**\n",
