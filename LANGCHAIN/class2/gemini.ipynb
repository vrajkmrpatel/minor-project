    "\n",
    "    ### **Step-by-Step Approach:**\n",
    "    1. **Identify Domain Concepts:**\n",
    "    - Extract all important **nouns** and **noun phrases** representing key domain concepts.\n",
    "    - If a noun represents a real-world entity, role, or system component, classify it as a **class**.\n",
    "    - If two nouns are frequently mentioned together or are logically linked, treat them as **correlated classes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Define Class Names:**\n",
    "    - Convert identified nouns into PascalCase to create valid class names.\n",
    "    - Avoid generic or ambiguous terms — focus on domain-specific terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Ensure Coherence Between Classes:**\n",
    "    - If two or more classes are logically related, group them as correlated classes.\n",
    "    - If a term is referenced multiple times in different contexts, consolidate it into a single class where appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **Ignore Unrelated or Redundant Terms:**\n",
    "    - Ignore adjectives, adverbs, and irrelevant terms unless they provide context.\n",
    "    - Focus on domain-relevant terms only.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### **Output Format (Strict JSON):**\n",
    "    Return only valid JSON in the following format:\n",
    "    {{\n",
    "        \"classes\": [\"Class1\", \"Class2\", \"Class3\"]\n",

    "\n",
    "    Problem Statement:\n",

    "    ### **Step-by-Step Approach:**\n",

    "       - If a verb is associated with an object or role, treat it as a candidate for a class operation.\n",

    "    2. **Ensure Coherence Between Classes and Operations:**\n",
    "       - If two or more classes are logically related, ensure their operations are consistent.\n",
    "       - Make sure that the operations are relevant to the class context.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Ignore Unrelated or Redundant Terms:**\n",
    "       - Ignore adjectives, adverbs, and irrelevant terms unless they provide meaningful context.\n",
    "       - Focus on meaningful, domain-relevant terms only.\n",
    "\n",

    "    1️⃣ **Association** - One class interacts with another. Example: \"User borrows Book\".\n",
    "    2️⃣ **Generalization (Inheritance)** - One class is a specialized form of another. Example: \"Admin is a subclass of User\".\n",
    "    3️⃣ **Aggregation** - One class is made up of another, but they have independent lifecycles. Example: \"Library has Books, but Books exist independently\".\n",
