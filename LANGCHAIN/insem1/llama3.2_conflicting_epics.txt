After analyzing the user stories and requirements for the insurance company's digital platform, I've identified three EPICs with conflicting user stories:

**EPIC 1: Policy Pricing vs. Customer Expectations**

* Conflicting User Stories:
	+ As a customer, I want to receive personalized quotes based on my specific needs (User Story #5).
	+ As NYU Management, I want to ensure that our pricing is competitive and aligns with industry standards (User Story #9).

**Conflict:**
The conflict arises from the tension between providing customers with tailored quotes and ensuring that prices remain competitive in the market. NYU Management wants to maintain a level of standardization in pricing to simplify operations, while customers expect personalized quotes to ensure they're getting the best value for their money.

**Resolution Strategy:**

✅ **Price Range Calculation:** 
- Develop an algorithm that calculates a price range based on industry standards and customer requirements.
- Present this range to the customer, allowing them to adjust within those parameters.

✅ **Dynamic Pricing Adjustments:** 
- Implement a system that allows NYU Management to make adjustments to pricing on the fly, while maintaining transparency with customers.
- Consider factors like market trends, competition, and customer behavior when making price changes.

**EPIC 2: Customer Service vs. Business Efficiency**

* Conflicting User Stories:
	+ As an insurance agent, I want to receive real-time notifications for policy updates (User Story #10).
	+ As NYU Management, I want to minimize the number of interactions with customers through automation and streamlined processes (User Story #6).

**Conflict:**
The conflict between providing timely customer service and maintaining business efficiency creates tension. While agents value real-time updates to ensure seamless client experiences, management prioritizes reducing unnecessary interactions to streamline operations.

**Resolution Strategy:**

✅ **Automated Notification Thresholds:** 
- Establish thresholds for when automated notifications are sufficient versus when human intervention is required.
- Use AI-driven analytics to determine the best balance between automation and customer engagement.

✅ **Proactive Agent Engagement:** 
- Implement a system that proactively engages agents with customers, such as sending targeted messages or making initial contact via phone or email.
- Provide clear guidelines for agents on when to escalate issues to management.

**EPIC 3: Data Security vs. Customer Access**

* Conflicting User Stories:
	+ As a customer, I want to view my personalized insurance package details (User Story #4).
	+ As NYU Management, I want to ensure that sensitive data is protected from unauthorized access and breaches (User Story #9).

**Conflict:**
The conflict between providing customers with convenient access to their personal data and safeguarding against data breaches creates a challenge. While customers value transparency and control over their information, management prioritizes protecting sensitive data.

**Resolution Strategy:**

✅ **Data Access Controls:** 
- Implement role-based access controls that restrict customer view-only permissions for sensitive data.
- Provide clear explanations of why certain data points are restricted and how they're used to support the business.

✅ **Biometric Authentication:** 
- Explore the use of biometric authentication methods, such as facial recognition or fingerprint scanning, to enhance security measures without compromising user experience.

These EPICs highlight potential conflicts between competing requirements. By analyzing these conflicts and proposing resolution strategies, we can create a more cohesive digital platform that balances customer needs with business efficiency and data security.
