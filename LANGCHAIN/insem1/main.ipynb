Consider yourself as a part of Requirement Analyst team at Retinodes Software Company, and your job is to gather and prioritize the set of requirements. In this new requirement of the project, there are no existing systems that can be analyzed for the development. Requirements have to be gathered, negotiated, validated and prioritized through multiple stakeholders which is a complex process because all stakeholders have different perspectives, requirements and priorities. Therefore, Retinodes want to have a requirements engineering framework that can be used in market-facing projects. To start with, you need to identify the set of stakeholders associated with the system, the domain information about the insurance market, and possible features. The first product NYU wanted you to develop consolidated insurance packages which can compete with the packages provided by other insurance companies. Another product is based on the customer priority, based on the insurance policies available the customer can create his/her own package and send a request for the review. The system has to automatically analyze the package, provide suggestions (if any), and at last give a competing price for the package. To understand the problem domain, existing packages has to be analyzed and the demands and restrictions from the insurance policy and agents have to be understood completely. The requirements and feasibility report generated by you, will further used by the development team for implementation.\"\"\""
