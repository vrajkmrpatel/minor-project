**2. End-users:**

* **Primary End-users:** Insurance Agents

* The system should automatically analyze the package, provide suggestions (if any), and give a competing price for the package.
* The system should support multiple insurance policies available for customer selection.
* The system should enable agents to review and approve/reject customized package requests.
* The system should allow customers to send requests for package review.
* The system should provide real-time quotes for customized packages.

**4. Non-functional Requirements:**

* **Performance:** High availability with 99.9% uptime, fast response times for user interactions.
* **Security:** Protect sensitive customer and agent information, prevent unauthorized access to system resources.
* **Usability:** Intuitive interface for customers and agents, easy navigation and search functionality.
* **Scalability:** Ability to handle increasing traffic and user growth without compromising performance.

Please note that I've made logical assumptions where information was ambiguous or unclear. These assumptions are documented explicitly in the report.
