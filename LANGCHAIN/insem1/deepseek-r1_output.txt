Okay, so I need to help extract the requirements from this problem statement about a Market-Driven Insurance System. The task is structured into four parts: stakeholders, end-users, functional requirements, and non-functional requirements.

Let me start by reading through the problem statement carefully. The main goal is for NYU, an insurance company, to digitize various business processes and provide a complete solution that addresses all aspects of the agent-insurer relationship. There are no existing systems in Retinodes Software Company's current analysis, so they need a requirements framework.

The first product will be a consolidated insurance package that can compete with other companies, and another based on customer priority where the customer creates their own package to review. The system must automatically analyze the package, suggest improvements if possible, and provide a competitive price. Understanding the problem domain requires analyzing existing packages, comprehending the demands and restrictions from policies and agents, and generating a requirements report for development.

Now, I need to extract each part step by step.

**1️⃣ Stakeholders:** The primary stakeholders are directly involved in system development, usage, or decision-making. From the problem statement, these include insurance company executives, business analysts, government regulators, competitors, and others who might be affected. Secondary stakeholders are those indirectly impacted but influencing the system—maybe customers or users of the software.

**2️⃣ End-users:** These would be people involved in using the system. Probably customers since they use insurance packages, agents for personalized plans, business analysts for data handling, and government regulators as policy制定者. Competing insurance firms might also be secondary stakeholders but users could include their clients or customers.

**3️⃣ Functional Requirements:** The system must allow creating personal insurance packages, analyze them, suggest improvements if needed, and provide competitive prices. Security is important too—data privacy for customer information, encryption to protect data, and compliance with regulations like GDPR or CCPA.

**4️⃣ Non-functional Requirements:** Performance should be good with 99.9% uptime, scalability for future growth, security (again), and usability for easy interaction without technical knowledge.

I think I have a good grasp now. Let me structure this into a numbered list as instructed.

Here is the structured extraction of the problem statement requirements:

1️⃣ **Stakeholders:** Primary stakeholders include Insurance Company Executives, Business Analysts, Government Regulators, Competing Insurance Firms, and Stakeholder Groups. Secondary stakeholders may consist of Customers, Agents, Legal Counsel, Policy Designers, and users like Customers or Clients.

2️⃣ **End-Users:** These are the people who use the system. They include Customers (end-users), Agents (business Analysts), Policy Designers (functional requirements), Legal Counsel (non-functional requirements), Government Regulators, and Stakeholder Groups (primary stakeholders).

3️⃣ **Functional Requirements:** 
   - Develop a system capable of creating comprehensive insurance packages.
   - Implement features for analyzing package details.
   - Provide suggestions if improvements are needed.
   - Offer competitive pricing mechanisms.

4️⃣ **Non-Functional Requirements:**
   - Ensure high availability with 99.9% uptime.
   - Design scalable solutions for future growth.
   - Maintain security standards, including GDPR and CCPA compliance.
   - Ensure usability to prevent technical barriers for non-expert users.

This framework allows the development team to prioritize requirements based on stakeholder needs while ensuring comprehensive functionality and performance across all aspects of the insurance system.
