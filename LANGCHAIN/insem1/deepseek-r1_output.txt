Okay, so I need to act as a requirement analyst for the Market-Driven Insurance System project at Retinodes Software Company. The task involves gathering requirements from primary and secondary stakeholders, identifying end-users, functional requirements, and non-functional requirements. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should identify the primary stakeholders. According to the problem statement, they are directly involved in system development, usage, or decision-making. For NYU, the key stakeholders would likely be insurance company executives, business analysts, and maybe some regulatory bodies. They have the most control over the system's direction and implementation.

Secondary stakeholders are those indirectly affected but still influence the system. From the problem statement, these might include government regulators who oversee insurance regulations, competitive insurance firms that could challenge or compete with NYU's solution, and possibly stakeholders like customers who might use the system to improve their own packages based on market demands.

Next, I need to list the different categories of end-users. From the problem statement, this includes agents, customers, businesses, government agencies, regulatory bodies, insurance companies, and potential competitors or suppliers. Each category has specific roles and responsibilities in using the system.

For functional requirements, I should define what features the system must perform. The first product is a consolidated insurance package that can compete with others. So, this needs to handle data entry for agents, provide analysis suggestions when they review packages, automatically analyze existing packages, offer price suggestions, and have a competitive pricing mechanism. These are all part of the core functionality.

Non-functional requirements focus on how the system should behave. Performance is crucial since the system will be used by insurance companies across different regions. So, high availability with 99.9% uptime needs to be addressed, considering possible data loss incidents. Security is another key area; encryption and secure communication channels are necessary to protect sensitive customer information. Scalability is important because insurancers might expand into new markets over time. Lastly, usability must ensure the system is user-friendly for both agents and customers.

I should make sure each requirement is clearly defined in terms of functionality and how it impacts performance. For example, high availability affects revenue from insurance companies, while security protects customer data that could be sensitive.

I also need to consider if any information is ambiguous or unclear. The problem statement mentions potential competitors and suppliers, which I can include as secondary stakeholders. Also, the requirement about competitive pricing suggests that NYU wants to offer something better than others, so I should note that price competition is part of the system's functionality.

Putting it all together, I'll structure my output with numbered lists for each section: Stakeholders, End-users, Functional Requirements, Non-functional Requirements. Each point will be clear and concise based on the analysis.
