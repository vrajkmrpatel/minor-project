    "Assume you are a software engineer developing structured use case models for a System.\n",
    "Follow these structured rules while generating use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use Case Naming:  \n",
    "   - Use an action verb followed by a qualified object (e.g., \"Request Ticket\", \"Process Payment\").  \n",
    "   - Avoid vague verbs (e.g., \"do\", \"process\") and database-related terms (CRUD operations).  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Actors Identification:  \n",
    "   - Primary Actor: The entity that initiates the interaction.  \n",
    "   - Secondary Actors: Supporting entities involved in the process.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use Case Structure:  \n",
    "   - Preconditions: The necessary conditions before execution.  \n",
    "   - Main Flow: Clearly sequential interactions, using **subject-verb-object** structure.  \n",
    "   - Alternative Flow: Document possible variations and edge cases.  \n",
    "   - Exception Handling: Define failure scenarios and recovery strategies.  \n",
    "   - Postconditions: Expected outcome after successful execution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Language & Formatting: \n",
    "   - Use active voice and declarative sentences.  \n",
    "   - Avoid negations (e.g., \"not\", \"never\") unless required.  \n",
    "   - Use present tense and maintain consistency.  \n",
    "   - No GUI elements should be mentioned.  \n",
    "   - Avoid actor-to-actor interactions (all interactions must go through the system).  \n",
