      "🧠 Questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "🤖 Answers:\n",
      "The provided PlantUML diagram is a simplified and inaccurate representation of the problem statement.  Several crucial aspects are missing and some actions are misplaced.  Here's a breakdown of the issues and answers to implied questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Missing Actors:** The diagram lacks actors.  There should be at least two:  `Employee` and `Guest`.  The system itself should also be represented, perhaps as a `CarParkSystem`.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Inaccurate Sequencing:** The diagram suggests that issuing an identity card (`issueIdentityCard`) happens *after* card verification.  This is incorrect.  Identity cards are issued *before* an employee attempts to enter the car park.  Similarly, collecting a guest card (`collectGuestCard`) should be separate from the car park entry process.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Missing Guest Card Verification:** The diagram doesn't show the verification process for guest cards.  This is a critical part of the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Missing Car Park Capacity Check:** The diagram shows `displayFullSign`, but doesn't show the logic for determining when the car park is full.  This requires a mechanism to track available spaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5.  Ambiguous \"mergeAfterValidation\":** The activity `mergeAfterValidation` is unclear and unnecessary.  The flow should be distinct for employees and guests.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6.  Missing Exit Process:** The diagram entirely omits the exit process for both employees and guests.  The exit barrier should be handled separately.\n",
      "\n",
      "**7.  Incorrect Placement of `displayFullSign`:** Displaying the \"Full\" sign should be triggered by a car park capacity check, not after a successful card verification.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, the PlantUML diagram needs significant revision.**  A more accurate diagram would involve separate swimlanes for the Employee and Guest processes, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Employee:**  Issue Identity Card (off-diagram, pre-entry), Arrive at Barrier, Insert Card, Verify Card (System), Raise Barrier (System), Enter Car Park, Exit Car Park, Lower Barrier (System).\n",
      "* **Guest:** Collect Guest Card (Reception), Arrive at Barrier, Insert Card, Verify Card (System), Raise Barrier (System), Enter Car Park, Exit Car Park, Return Guest Card (Reception), Lower Barrier (System).\n",
      "* **System:**  Monitor Car Park Capacity, Display \"Full\" Sign (if capacity reached), Verify Employee Card, Verify Guest Card.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The diagram should also clearly show the interaction between the card reader, the barrier, and the \"Full\" sign.  The current diagram is too simplistic to accurately represent the system's functionality.\n",

Each card records the name, department and number of a company staff, and give them access to the company car park.\\nEmployees are asked to wear the cards while on the site. There is a barrier and a card reader placed at the entrance to the car park. When a driver drives his\\ncar into the car park, he/she inserts his or her identity card into the card reader. The card reader then verify the card number to see if it is known to the system. If the number is recognized, the reader sends a signal to trigger the barrier to rise. The driver can then drive his/her car into the car park.\\nThere is another barrier at the exit of the car park, which is automatically raised when a car wishes to leave the car park.\\nA sign at the entrance display “Full” when there are no spaces in the car park. It is only switched off when a car leaves. There is another type of card for guests, which also permits access to the car park. The card records a number and the current date. Such cards may be sent out in advance, or collected from reception. All guest cards must be returned to reception when the visitor leaves Saturn Int.\\n'"

      "🤖 LLM Answers to Questionnaire:\n",
      " 1. Answer to Question 1:  The initial node should be replaced with a decision node labeled \"Interaction Method?\".  Two branches will emerge: one labeled \"Web\" and the other \"Phone\".  The \"identifyCustomer\" activity will follow both branches, but subsequent activities might differ depending on the interaction method (e.g.,  catalog request might be more prominent on the web). The modified start would look like this:\n",

      "endif\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Answer to Question 2:  The \"identifyCustomer\" activity should be replaced with a decision node labeled \"Existing Customer?\".  If yes, the customer provides their customer number. If no, they provide their name and address.  This branching logic should be added immediately after the \"Interaction Method?\" decision node (from Question 1), before any other actions.  The diagram would include:\n",
