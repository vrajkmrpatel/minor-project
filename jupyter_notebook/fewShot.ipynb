Research Best Practices: Look at how other universities or educational institutions are handling course registration online and note down the best functionalities.\\n\\n7. Use Surveys: Create and distribute surveys to a larger student and faculty population to gather broader feedback about their perspectives and experiences.\\n\\n8. Define User Roles: Understand the different users of the system (students, professors, administrative staff, etc.) and identify the tasks and functions they will need to perform.\\n\\n9. Set Goals: Identify the goals of the system in terms of usage, capacity, user satisfaction, and so on.\\n\\n10. Prioritize Requirements: Some features might be essential, and others could be nice-to-have. Classify requirements depending on their priority to effectively manage development.\\n\\n11. Documentation: Write down all the collected requirements in a document and present it to the project team and stakeholders. \\n\\nRemember that requirements gathering is an iterative process, so it is important to check back regularly with the stakeholders and users as the project progresses to ensure the system meets their needs.'\n",

Additionally, it may not be able to handle large amounts of traffic as effectively as the other architectures.\\n\\nB: Microservices Architecture Implementation Plan: Rank 1\\n\\nJustification: The microservices architecture offers the greatest flexibility and scalability. It allows for independent development and deployment of services, making it easier to update and maintain. It also handles large amounts of traffic effectively. However, it is more complex to develop and requires careful coordination of services.\\n\\nC: Serverless Architecture Implementation Plan: Rank 2\\n\\nJustification: The serverless architecture offers scalability and the ability to pay only for the compute time you consume. However, it can lead to vendor lock-in, and there may be latency issues for certain types of applications. Debugging and monitoring can also be more challenging in a serverless architecture.\\n\\nFinal Thoughts: The choice of architecture depends on the specific needs and constraints of the project. While the microservices architecture is ranked first, it may not be the best choice for a small, simple application. Similarly, the serverless architecture may be the best choice for an application that needs to scale quickly and doesn't require long-running processes. The monolithic architecture, while ranked last, may still be the best choice for certain types of applications.\"}\n"
