Most providers say a fever is either 100.0 F (37.8 C) or 100.4 F (38 C). When you have a fever, it’s your body’s normal response to fighting an infection or illness. Fevers usually aren’t a serious concern. They typically go away when the infection passes.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

A fever itself isn’t an illness. Rather, it’s a symptom of a wide range of health conditions. When your body temperature rises a few degrees above normal, it can be a sign that your immune system has been activated, often to fight an infection. AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyWhat is considered a fever?Common knowledge states that a “normal” body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius). But your baseline body temperature may vary by a degree or more. It also fluctuates. It’s typically lower in the morning and higher in the evening. It’s higher during certain points of your menstrual cycle and when you’re exercising.Infants and young children normally have slightly higher body temperatures than older children and adults. So infants and younger children have slightly higher fever temperatures.There are no strict guidelines for what temperature is a fever, because body temperature varies by person, time of day and method of measurement. But healthcare providers most often say a fever temperature is 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C) when measured orally (by mouth).Rectal and ear thermometers typically measure temperatures at about 1.0 degrees F (0.6 degrees C) higher than oral thermometers. Skin thermometers (such as forehead thermometers) typically measure temperatures at about 1.0 degrees F (0.6 degrees C) lower than oral thermometers.What is a low-grade fever?A low-grade fever means a body temperature slightly above normal. This type of fever can be a sign your immune system has been mildly activated. There’s no standard low-grade fever range. But many healthcare providers consider a body temperature between 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit (37.5 degrees Celsius) and 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit (37.9 degrees Celsius) to be a low-grade fever.AdvertisementWhat are fever symptoms?In addition to an elevated temperature, you may experience the following symptoms:Chills, feeling cold, shivering and shaking.Body aches and headaches.Fatigue (tiredness).On and off or constant sweating.Flushed complexion or hot skin.Faster heart beats.Additional fever symptoms in babies and children may include:Lack of appetite — not eating and drinking well.Earache or pulling at their ears.High-pitched crying.Fussiness.Paleness or flushness.Excessive thirst.Decreased urination.Possible CausesWhat are the most common causes of fever?A fever has many causes and can be a symptom of almost any illness. Common conditions that cause fever include:Bacterial infections.Viral infections such as influenza or COVID-19.Gastrointestinal (GI) infections.Urinary tract infections.Skin infections.You may also develop a fever due to:A reaction to certain medications.Vaccinations.Autoimmune disorders.Cancer.Can allergies cause fever?Allergies can cause cold-like symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes, but they typically don’t cause fever. Despite its name, hay fever (also called allergic rhinitis) doesn’t cause fever.Care and TreatmentWhat’s the best way to measure body temperature?You can take your temperature in several different parts of your body. The most common site is your mouth (oral temperature). Other sites include your ear (tympanic membrane), forehead (temporal artery) and armpit (axillary). The most accurate site is the rectum, and the least accurate site is the armpit.The best way to measure your temperature is with a digital thermometer. Glass thermometers contain mercury and providers no longer recommend them.How can I break a fever at home?If your fever is mild — less than 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C) — you usually don’t need treatment with medication. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids and get plenty of rest. Taking a lukewarm bath — about 98 degrees F (36.7 degrees C) — may also help bring your body’s temperature down. Keep an eye on signs of dehydration and other worsening symptoms.If you’re feeling uncomfortable and your temperature is higher than 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C), you can try to break the fever. The most common way to get rid of a fever is to use over-the-counter (OTC) medications such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including ibuprofen, naproxen and aspirin.Don’t give aspirin to children under the age of 17. Aspirin in children may cause Reye’s syndrome, a sometimes fatal illness.Does ibuprofen reduce fever?Yes, you can take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen to try to reduce a fever.How long does a fever last?The cause of the fever determines how long it’ll last. Typically, if an infection is the cause of your fever, it should pass within three to four days. Call your healthcare provider if the fever lingers longer than that or comes along with breathing changes.AdvertisementCare at Cleveland ClinicFind a Primary Care ProviderSchedule an AppointmentWhen To Call the DoctorWhen should a fever be treated by a healthcare provider?In adults, fevers less than 103 degrees F (39.4 degrees C) typically aren’t dangerous and aren’t a cause for concern. If your fever rises above that level, make a call to your healthcare provider for treatment.In children, call your child’s healthcare provider if:Their fever lasts more than five days.Their fever is higher than 104 degrees F (40 degrees C).Medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen don’t break the fever.You’re concerned they aren’t behaving normally.They have any problems breathing or urinating.When should I go to the ER?If you have a fever along with any of the following symptoms, go to your nearest emergency room or call 911. It may be a sign of a serious or life-threatening illness.Pain or tenderness in your belly (abdomen).Nausea or vomiting.Severe headache.Stiff neck.Light irritates your eyes (photophobia).Convulsions or seizures.Difficulty breathing.Strange behavior and/or altered speech.Confusion or irritability.Difficulty waking or extreme sleepiness.Fever rash (small bleeding spots under your skin).When should I take my child to the ER?If your baby has a fever and is under 3 months of age, take them to the ER right away. Your baby’s immune system hasn’t developed fully yet, and they could have a serious infection.AdvertisementIf your child has a fever along with any of the following symptoms, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room:Extreme sluggishness or drowsiness.Lack of appetite.Excessive drooling or difficulty swallowing.Continuous crying.Stiff neck.Fever rash.Difficulty breathing.Severe abdominal pain.Redness or swelling.Dehydration (not drinking many fluids).Decreased urination.What are the possible complications or risks of not treating a fever?Untreated fevers above 105.8 degrees F (41 degrees C) can be dangerous. If your body temperature reaches this level, your organs will begin to malfunction and will eventually fail.Even moderate fevers can be dangerous for adults with lung or heart disorders because fever causes your breathing rate and heart rate to increase. Fever can also worsen the mental state of people with dementia.Additional Common QuestionsWhat is a recurrent fever?A recurrent fever is a fever that keeps coming back multiple times over a period of time. Providers call these fevers episodic because they come and go. The fever lasts for a few days and then goes away for a stretch of time. Your child is healthy and acts normally between fevers. Recurrent fevers affect young children under the age of 5 most often. They’re one of the main symptoms of a collection of conditions called periodic fever syndromes.AdvertisementWhat is a febrile seizure?Some children have a side effect of fevers called febrile seizures. This happens in 2% to 4% of children under the age of 5. Some seizures cause jerking movements, or it may look like your child has passed out. When this happens, put your child on their side and don’t put anything in their mouth. Call 911 if the seizure lasts for more than five minutes and/or your child’s lips turn blue.If the seizure lasts less than five minutes, notify their healthcare provider and get medical attention right away.What is a fever dream?Fever dreams are vivid, bizarre or unpleasant dreams you may experience when your body temperature rises higher than normal. Researchers don’t know the exact cause of fever dreams. But some scientists think fevers cause your brain to “overheat,” affecting your cognitive processing, which results in dreams stranger than your typical dreams. Fevers may also interrupt your REM sleep cycle, which can lead to unusual dreams.A note from Cleveland ClinicWhile a fever can be uncomfortable, it’s typically a sign that your body is working properly and your immune system is kicking into action. You don’t need to treat low fevers, but you can take over-the-counter pain relievers until they pass. If you or your child has a higher temperature or your fever hasn’t passed within a few days, you should make a call to your healthcare provider. While infections most often cause fevers, there could be other underlying conditions you’ll want to get checked out.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed on 05/31/2023.Learn more about the Health Library and our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementAdvertisementAdQuestions 216.444.2538Appointments & LocationsRequest an AppointmentFind a Primary Care ProviderRendered: Thu Jan 30 2025 03:20:07 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)FacebookTwitterYouTubeInstagramLinkedInPinterestSnapchatActionsAppointments & AccessAccepted InsuranceEvents CalendarFinancial AssistanceGive to Cleveland ClinicPay Your Bill OnlineRefer a PatientPhone DirectoryVirtual Second OpinionsVirtual VisitsBlog, News & AppsConsult QDHealth EssentialsNewsroomMyClevelandClinicMyChartAbout Cleveland Clinic100 Years of Cleveland ClinicAbout UsLocationsQuality & Patient SafetyOffice of Diversity & InclusionPatient ExperienceResearch & InnovationsCommunity CommitmentCareersFor EmployeesResources for Medical ProfessionalsSite Information & PoliciesSend Us FeedbackSite MapAbout this WebsiteCopyright, Reprint & LicensingWebsite Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyNotice of Privacy PracticesNon-Discrimination Notice9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 800.223.2273 | © 2025 Cleveland Clinic.

Sleeping with a fever can often cause intense or confusing nightmares, commonly called \"fever dreams\".[23] Mild to severe delirium (which can also cause hallucinations) may also present itself during high fevers.[24]\\n\\nDiagnosis[edit]\\n\\nTemperature classification\\n Core (rectal, esophageal, etc.) Hypothermia <35.0\\xa0°C (95.0\\xa0°F)[25] Normal 36.5–37.5\\xa0°C (97.7–99.5\\xa0°F)[26][27] Fever >37.5 or 38.3\\xa0°C (99.5 or 100.9\\xa0°F)[1][8] Hyperthermia >37.5 or 38.3\\xa0°C (99.5 or 100.9\\xa0°F)[1][8] Hyperpyrexia >40.0 or 41.0\\xa0°C (104.0 or 105.8\\xa0°F)[28][29]\\n\\nNote: The difference between fever and hyperthermia is the underlying mechanism. Different sources have different cut-offs for fever, hyperthermia and hyperpyrexia.\\nvte\\nA range for normal temperatures has been found.[8] Central temperatures, such as rectal temperatures, are more accurate than peripheral temperatures.[30]\\nFever is generally agreed to be present if the elevated temperature[31] is caused by a raised set point and:\\n\\nTemperature in the anus (rectum/rectal) is at or over 37.5–38.3\\xa0°C (99.5–100.9\\xa0°F).[1][8] An ear (tympanic) or forehead (temporal) temperature may also be used.[32][33]\\nTemperature in the mouth (oral) is at or over 37.2\\xa0°C (99.0\\xa0°F) in the morning or over 37.7\\xa0°C (99.9\\xa0°F) in the afternoon[7][34]\\nTemperature under the arm (axillary) is usually about 0.6\\xa0°C (1.1\\xa0°F) below core body temperature.[35]\\nIn adults, the normal range of oral temperatures in healthy individuals is 35.7–37.7\\xa0°C (96.3–99.9\\xa0°F) among men and 33.2–38.1\\xa0°C (91.8–100.6\\xa0°F) among women, while when taken rectally it is 36.7–37.5\\xa0°C (98.1–99.5\\xa0°F) among men and 36.8–37.1\\xa0°C (98.2–98.8\\xa0°F) among women, and for ear measurement it is 35.5–37.5\\xa0°C (95.9–99.5\\xa0°F) among men and 35.7–37.5\\xa0°C (96.3–99.5\\xa0°F) among women.[36]\\nNormal body temperatures vary depending on many factors, including age, sex, time of day, ambient temperature, activity level, and more.[37][38]  Normal daily temperature variation has been described as 0.5\\xa0°C (0.9\\xa0°F).[7]:\\u200a4012\\u200a  A raised temperature is not always a fever.[37]  For example, the temperature rises in healthy people when they exercise, but this is not considered a fever, as the set point is normal.[37] On the other hand, a \"normal\" temperature may be a fever, if it is unusually high for that person; for example, medically frail elderly people have a decreased ability to generate body heat, so a \"normal\" temperature of 37.3\\xa0°C (99.1\\xa0°F) may represent a clinically significant fever.[37][39]\\n\\nHyperthermia[edit]\\nHyperthermia is an elevation of body temperature over the temperature set point, due to either too much heat production or not enough heat loss.[1][7] Hyperthermia is thus not considered fever.[7]:\\u200a103\\u200a[40] Hyperthermia should not be confused with hyperpyrexia (which is a very high fever).[7]:\\u200a102\\u200a\\nClinically, it is important to distinguish between fever and hyperthermia as hyperthermia may quickly lead to death and does not respond to antipyretic medications. The distinction may however be difficult to make in an emergency setting, and is often established by identifying possible causes.[7]:\\u200a103\\u200a\\n\\nTypes[edit]\\nDifferent fever patterns observed in Plasmodium infectionsVarious patterns of measured patient temperatures have been observed, some of which may be indicative of a particular medical diagnosis:\\nContinuous fever, where temperature remains above normal and does not fluctuate more than 1\\xa0°C in 24 hours[41] (e.g. in bacterial pneumonia, typhoid fever, infective endocarditis, tuberculosis, or typhus).[42][43]\\nIntermittent fever is present only for a certain period, later cycling back to normal (e.g., in malaria, leishmaniasis, pyemia, sepsis,[44] or African trypanosomiasis).[45]\\nRemittent fever, where the temperature remains above normal throughout the day and fluctuates more than 1\\xa0°C in 24 hours (e.g., in infective endocarditis or brucellosis).[46]\\nPel–Ebstein fever is a cyclic fever that is rarely seen in patients with Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma.\\nUndulant fever, seen in brucellosis.\\nTyphoid fever is a continuous fever showing a characteristic step-ladder pattern, a step-wise increase in temperature with a high plateau.[47]\\nAmong the types of intermittent fever are ones specific to cases of malaria caused by different pathogens. These are:[48][49]\\n\\nQuotidian fever, with a 24-hour periodicity, typical of malaria caused by Plasmodium knowlesi (P. knowlesi);[50][51]\\nTertian fever, with a 48-hour periodicity, typical of later course malaria caused by P. falciparum, P. vivax, or P. ovale;[48]\\nQuartan fever, with a 72-hour periodicity, typical of later course malaria caused by P. malariae.[48]\\nIn addition, there is disagreement regarding whether a specific fever pattern is associated with Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma—the Pel–Ebstein fever, with patients argued to present high temperature for one week, followed by low for the next week, and so on, where the generality of this pattern is debated.[52][53]\\nPersistent fever that cannot be explained after repeated routine clinical inquiries is called fever of unknown origin.[7][54] A neutropenic fever, also called febrile neutropenia, is a fever in the absence of normal immune system function.[55] Because of the lack of infection-fighting neutrophils, a bacterial infection can spread rapidly; this fever is, therefore, usually considered to require urgent medical attention.[56] This kind of fever is more commonly seen in people receiving immune-suppressing chemotherapy than in apparently healthy people.[55][57]\\n\\nHyperpyrexia[edit]\\nHyperpyrexia is an extreme elevation of body temperature which, depending upon the source, is classified as a core body temperature greater than or equal to 40 or 41\\xa0°C (104 or 106\\xa0°F); the range of hyperpyrexia includes cases considered severe (≥ 40\\xa0°C) and extreme (≥ 42\\xa0°C).[7][58][59] It differs from hyperthermia in that one\\'s thermoregulatory system\\'s set point for body temperature is set above normal, then heat is generated to achieve it. In contrast, hyperthermia involves body temperature rising above its set point due to outside factors.[7][60] The high temperatures of hyperpyrexia are considered medical emergencies, as they may indicate a serious underlying condition or lead to severe morbidity (including permanent brain damage), or to death.[61] A common cause of hyperpyrexia is an intracranial hemorrhage.[7] Other causes in emergency room settings include Malignant Catatonia, sepsis, Kawasaki syndrome,[62] neuroleptic malignant syndrome, drug overdose, serotonin syndrome, and thyroid storm.[61]\\n\\nDifferential diagnosis[edit]\\nFever is a common symptom of many medical conditions:\\n\\nInfectious disease, e.g., COVID-19,[14] dengue, Ebola, gastroenteritis, HIV, influenza, Lyme disease, rocky mountain spotted fever, secondary syphilis, malaria, mononucleosis, as well as infections of the skin, e.g., abscesses and boils.[63][64][65][66][67][68]\\nImmunological diseases, e.g., relapsing polychondritis,[69] autoimmune hepatitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Horton disease, inflammatory bowel diseases, Kawasaki disease, lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, Still\\'s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, lymphoproliferative disorders and psoriasis;[citation needed]\\nTissue destruction, as a result of cerebral bleeding, crush syndrome, hemolysis, infarction, rhabdomyolysis, surgery, etc.;[70][71]\\nCancers, particularly blood cancers such as leukemia and lymphomas;[72]\\nMetabolic disorders, e.g., gout, and porphyria;[73] and[74]\\nInherited metabolic disorder, e.g., Fabry disease.[7]\\nAdult and pediatric manifestations for the same disease may differ; for instance, in COVID-19, one metastudy describes 92.8% of adults versus 43.9% of children presenting with fever.[14]\\nIn addition, fever can result from a reaction to an incompatible blood product.[75]\\n\\nFunction[edit]\\nHyperthermia: Characterized on the left. Normal body temperature (thermoregulatory set point) is shown in green, while the hyperthermic temperature is shown in red. As can be seen, hyperthermia can be conceptualized as an increase above the thermoregulatory set point.Hypothermia: Characterized in the center: Normal body temperature is shown in green, while the hypothermic temperature is shown in blue. As can be seen, hypothermia can be conceptualized as a decrease below the thermoregulatory set point.Fever: Characterized on the right: Normal body temperature is shown in green. It reads \"New Normal\" because the thermoregulatory set point has risen. This has caused what was the normal body temperature (in blue) to be considered hypothermic.\\nImmune function[edit]\\nFever is thought to contribute to host defense,[17] as the reproduction of pathogens with strict temperature requirements can be hindered, and the rates of some important immunological reactions are increased by temperature.[76] Fever has been described in teaching texts as assisting the healing process in various ways, including:\\n\\nincreased mobility of leukocytes;[77]:\\u200a1044\\u200a\\nenhanced leukocyte phagocytosis;[77]:\\u200a1030\\u200a\\ndecreased endotoxin effects;[77]:\\u200a1029\\u200a and\\nincreased proliferation of T cells.[77]:\\u200a1030\\u200a[78]:\\u200a212\\u200a\\nAdvantages and disadvantages[edit]\\nA fever response to an infectious disease is generally regarded as protective, whereas fever in non-infections may be maladaptive.[79][80] Studies have not been consistent on whether treating fever generally worsens or improves mortality risk.[81] Benefits or harms may depend on the type of infection, health status of the patient and other factors.[79]  Studies using warm-blooded vertebrates suggest that they recover more rapidly from infections or critical illness due to fever.[82] In sepsis, fever is associated with reduced mortality.[83]\\n\\nPathophysiology of fever induction[edit]\\nSee also: Thermoregulation in humans\\nHypothalamus[edit]\\nTemperature is regulated in the hypothalamus. The trigger of a fever, called a pyrogen, results in the release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 in turn acts on the hypothalamus, which creates a systemic response in the body, causing heat-generating effects to match a new higher temperature set point. There are four receptors in which PGE2 can bind (EP1-4), with a previous study showing the EP3 subtype is what mediates the fever response.[84] Hence, the hypothalamus can be seen as working like a thermostat.[7] When the set point is raised, the body increases its temperature through both active generation of heat and retention of heat. Peripheral vasoconstriction both reduces heat loss through the skin and causes the person to feel cold. Norepinephrine increases thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue, and muscle contraction through shivering raises the metabolic rate.[85]\\nIf these measures are insufficient to make the blood temperature in the brain match the new set point in the hypothalamus, the brain orchestrates heat effector mechanisms via the autonomic nervous system or primary motor center for shivering. These may be:[86]\\n\\nIncreased heat production by increased muscle tone, shivering (muscle movements to produce heat) and release of hormones like epinephrine; and\\nPrevention of heat loss, e.g., through vasoconstriction.\\nWhen the hypothalamic set point moves back to baseline—either spontaneously or via medication—normal functions such as sweating, and the reverse of the foregoing processes (e.g., vasodilation, end of shivering, and nonshivering heat production) are used to cool the body to the new, lower setting.[citation needed]\\nThis contrasts with hyperthermia, in which the normal setting remains, and the body overheats through undesirable retention of excess heat or over-production of heat. Hyperthermia is usually the result of an excessively hot environment (heat stroke) or an adverse reaction to drugs. Fever can be differentiated from hyperthermia by the circumstances surrounding it and its response to anti-pyretic medications.[7][verification needed]\\nIn infants, the autonomic nervous system may also activate brown adipose tissue to produce heat (non-shivering thermogenesis).[87]\\nIncreased heart rate and vasoconstriction contribute to increased blood pressure in fever.[88]\\n\\nPyrogens[edit]\\nA pyrogen is a substance that induces fever.[89] In the presence of an infectious agent, such as bacteria, viruses, viroids, etc., the immune response of the body is to inhibit their growth and eliminate them. The most common pyrogens are endotoxins, which are lipopolysaccharides (LPS) produced by Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli. But pyrogens include non-endotoxic substances (derived from microorganisms other than gram-negative-bacteria or from chemical substances) as well.[90] The types of pyrogens include internal (endogenous) and external (exogenous) to the body.[91]\\nThe \"pyrogenicity\" of given pyrogens varies: in extreme cases, bacterial pyrogens can act as superantigens and cause rapid and dangerous fevers.[92]\\n\\nEndogenous[edit]\\nEndogenous pyrogens are cytokines released from monocytes (which are part of the immune system).[93] In general, they stimulate chemical responses, often in the presence of an antigen, leading to a fever. Whilst they can be a product of external factors like exogenous pyrogens, they can also be induced by internal factors like damage associated molecular patterns such as cases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus.[94]\\nMajor endogenous pyrogens are interleukin 1 (α and β)[95]:\\u200a1237–1248\\u200a and interleukin 6 (IL-6).[96] Minor endogenous pyrogens include interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-β, macrophage inflammatory protein-α and macrophage inflammatory protein-β as well as interferon-α, interferon-β, and interferon-γ.[95]:\\u200a1237–1248\\u200a Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) also acts as a pyrogen, mediated by interleukin 1 (IL-1) release.[97] These cytokine factors are released into general circulation, where they migrate to the brain\\'s circumventricular organs where they are more easily absorbed than in areas protected by the blood–brain barrier.[98] The cytokines then bind to endothelial receptors on vessel walls to receptors on microglial cells, resulting in activation of the arachidonic acid pathway.[99]\\nOf these, IL-1β, TNF, and IL-6 are able to raise the temperature setpoint of an organism and cause fever. These proteins produce a cyclooxygenase which induces the hypothalamic production of PGE2 which then stimulates the release of neurotransmitters such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate and increases body temperature.[100]\\n\\nExogenous[edit]\\nExogenous pyrogens are external to the body and are of microbial origin. In general, these pyrogens, including bacterial cell wall products, may act on Toll-like receptors in the hypothalamus and elevate the thermoregulatory setpoint.[101]\\nAn example of a class of exogenous pyrogens are bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) present in the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria. According to one mechanism of pyrogen action, an immune system protein, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), binds to LPS, and the LBP–LPS complex then binds to a CD14 receptor on a macrophage. The LBP-LPS binding to CD14 results in cellular synthesis and release of various endogenous cytokines, e.g., interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα). A further downstream event is activation of the arachidonic acid pathway.[102]\\n\\nPGE2 release[edit]\\nPGE2 release comes from the arachidonic acid pathway. This pathway (as it relates to fever), is mediated by the enzymes phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and prostaglandin E2 synthase. These enzymes ultimately mediate the synthesis and release of PGE2.[citation needed]\\nPGE2 is the ultimate mediator of the febrile response. The setpoint temperature of the body will remain elevated until PGE2 is no longer present. PGE2 acts on neurons in the preoptic area (POA) through the prostaglandin E receptor 3 (EP3). EP3-expressing neurons in the POA innervate the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), the rostral raphe pallidus nucleus in the medulla oblongata (rRPa), and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. Fever signals sent to the DMH and rRPa lead to stimulation of the sympathetic output system, which evokes non-shivering thermogenesis to produce body heat and skin vasoconstriction to decrease heat loss from the body surface. It is presumed that the innervation from the POA to the PVN mediates the neuroendocrine effects of fever through the pathway involving pituitary gland and various endocrine organs.[citation needed]\\n\\nManagement[edit]\\nFever does not necessarily need to be treated,[103] and most people with a fever recover without specific medical attention.[104] Although it is unpleasant, fever rarely rises to a dangerous level even if untreated.[105] Damage to the brain generally does not occur until temperatures reach 40.0\\xa0°C (104.0\\xa0°F), and it is rare for an untreated fever to exceed 40.6\\xa0°C (105.1\\xa0°F).[106] Treating fever in people with sepsis does not affect outcomes.[107] Small trials have shown no benefit of treating fevers of 38.5\\xa0°C (101.3\\xa0°F) or higher of critically ill patients in ICUs, and one trial was terminated early because patients receiving aggressive fever treatment were dying more often.[19]\\nAccording to the NIH, the two assumptions which are generally used to argue in favor of treating fevers have not been experimentally validated. These are that (1) a fever is noxious, and (2) suppression of a fever will reduce its noxious effect. Most of the other studies supporting the association of fever with poorer outcomes have been observational in nature. In theory, these critically ill patients and those faced with additional physiologic stress may benefit from fever reduction, but the evidence on both sides of the argument appears to be mostly equivocal.[19]\\n\\nConservative measures[edit]\\nLimited evidence supports sponging or bathing feverish children with tepid water.[108] The use of a fan or air conditioning may somewhat reduce the temperature and increase comfort. If the temperature reaches the extremely high level of hyperpyrexia, aggressive cooling is required (generally produced mechanically via conduction by applying numerous ice packs across most of the body or direct submersion in ice water).[61] In general, people are advised to keep adequately hydrated.[109] Whether increased fluid intake improves symptoms or shortens respiratory illnesses such as the common cold is not known.[110]\\n\\nMedications[edit]\\nMedications that lower fevers are called antipyretics.[111] The antipyretic ibuprofen is effective in reducing fevers in children.[112] It is more effective than acetaminophen (paracetamol) in children.[112] Ibuprofen and acetaminophen may be safely used together in children with fevers.[113][114] The efficacy of acetaminophen by itself in children with fevers has been questioned.[115] Ibuprofen is also superior to aspirin in children with fevers.[116] Additionally, aspirin is not recommended in children and young adults (those under the age of 16 or 19 depending on the country) due to the risk of Reye\\'s syndrome.[117]\\nUsing both paracetamol and ibuprofen at the same time or alternating between the two is more effective at decreasing fever than using only paracetamol or ibuprofen.[118] It is not clear if it increases child comfort.[118] Response or nonresponse to medications does not predict whether or not a child has a serious illness.[119]\\nWith respect to the effect of antipyretics on the risk of death in those with infection, studies have found mixed results, as of 2019.[120]\\n\\nEpidemiology[edit]\\nFever is one of the most common medical signs.[2] It is part of about 30% of healthcare visits by children,[2] and occurs in up to 75% of adults who are seriously sick.[11] About 5% of people who go to an emergency room have a fever.[121]\\n\\nHistory[edit]\\nA number of types of fever were known as early as 460 BC to 370 BC when Hippocrates was practicing medicine including that due to malaria (tertian or every 2 days and quartan or every 3 days).[122] It also became clear around this time that fever was a symptom of disease rather than a disease in and of itself.[122]\\nInfections presenting with fever were a major source of mortality in humans for about 200,000 years. Until the late nineteenth century, approximately half of all humans died from infections before the age of fifteen.[123]\\nAn older term, febricula (a diminutive form of the Latin word for fever), was once used to refer to a low-grade fever lasting only a few days. This term fell out of use in the early 20th century, and the symptoms it referred to are now thought to have been caused mainly by various minor viral respiratory infections.[124]\\n\\nSociety and culture[edit]\\nMythology[edit]\\nFebris\\nFebris (fever in Latin) is the goddess of fever  in Roman mythology. People with fevers would visit her temples.\\nTertiana and Quartana are the goddesses of tertian and quartan fevers of malaria in Roman mythology.[125]\\nJvarasura (fever-demon in Hindi) is the personification of fever and disease in Hindu and Buddhist mythology.\\nPediatrics[edit]\\nFever is often viewed with greater concern by parents and healthcare professionals than might be deserved, a phenomenon known as fever phobia,[2][126] which is based in both caregiver\\'s and parents\\' misconceptions about fever in children. Among them, many parents incorrectly believe that fever is a disease rather than a medical sign, that even low fevers are harmful, and that any temperature even briefly or slightly above the oversimplified \"normal\" number marked on a thermometer is a clinically significant fever.[126] They are also afraid of harmless side effects like febrile seizures and dramatically overestimate the likelihood of permanent damage from typical fevers.[126] The underlying problem, according to professor of pediatrics Barton D. Schmitt, is that \"as parents we tend to suspect that our children\\'s brains may melt.\"[127] As a result of these misconceptions parents are anxious, give the child fever-reducing medicine when the temperature is technically normal or only slightly elevated, and interfere with the child\\'s sleep to give the child more medicine.[126]\\n\\nOther species[edit]\\nMain article: Thermoregulation\\nFever is an important metric for the diagnosis of disease in domestic animals. The body temperature of animals, which is taken rectally, is different from one species to another. For example, a horse is said to have a fever above 101\\xa0°F (38.3\\xa0°C).[128] In species that allow the body to have a wide range of \"normal\" temperatures, such as camels,[129] whose body temperature varies as the environmental temperature varies,[130] the body temperature which constitutes a febrile state differs depending on the environmental temperature.[131] Fever can also be behaviorally induced by invertebrates that do not have immune-system based fever. For instance, some species of grasshopper will thermoregulate to achieve body temperatures that are 2–5\\xa0°C higher than normal in order to inhibit the growth of fungal pathogens such as Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium acridum.[132] Honeybee colonies are also able to induce a fever in response to a fungal parasite Ascosphaera apis.[132]\\n\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ a b c d e f g h i Axelrod YK, Diringer MN (May 2008). \"Temperature management in acute neurologic disorders\".

Most providers say a fever is either 100.0 F (37.8 C) or 100.4 F (38 C). When you have a fever, it’s your body’s normal response to fighting an infection or illness. Fevers usually aren’t a serious concern. They typically go away when the infection passes.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

A fever itself isn’t an illness. Rather, it’s a symptom of a wide range of health conditions. When your body temperature rises a few degrees above normal, it can be a sign that your immune system has been activated, often to fight an infection. AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyWhat is considered a fever?Common knowledge states that a “normal” body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius). But your baseline body temperature may vary by a degree or more. It also fluctuates. It’s typically lower in the morning and higher in the evening. It’s higher during certain points of your menstrual cycle and when you’re exercising.Infants and young children normally have slightly higher body temperatures than older children and adults. So infants and younger children have slightly higher fever temperatures.There are no strict guidelines for what temperature is a fever, because body temperature varies by person, time of day and method of measurement. But healthcare providers most often say a fever temperature is 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C) when measured orally (by mouth).Rectal and ear thermometers typically measure temperatures at about 1.0 degrees F (0.6 degrees C) higher than oral thermometers. Skin thermometers (such as forehead thermometers) typically measure temperatures at about 1.0 degrees F (0.6 degrees C) lower than oral thermometers.What is a low-grade fever?A low-grade fever means a body temperature slightly above normal. This type of fever can be a sign your immune system has been mildly activated. There’s no standard low-grade fever range. But many healthcare providers consider a body temperature between 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit (37.5 degrees Celsius) and 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit (37.9 degrees Celsius) to be a low-grade fever.AdvertisementWhat are fever symptoms?In addition to an elevated temperature, you may experience the following symptoms:Chills, feeling cold, shivering and shaking.Body aches and headaches.Fatigue (tiredness).On and off or constant sweating.Flushed complexion or hot skin.Faster heart beats.Additional fever symptoms in babies and children may include:Lack of appetite — not eating and drinking well.Earache or pulling at their ears.High-pitched crying.Fussiness.Paleness or flushness.Excessive thirst.Decreased urination.Possible CausesWhat are the most common causes of fever?A fever has many causes and can be a symptom of almost any illness. Common conditions that cause fever include:Bacterial infections.Viral infections such as influenza or COVID-19.Gastrointestinal (GI) infections.Urinary tract infections.Skin infections.You may also develop a fever due to:A reaction to certain medications.Vaccinations.Autoimmune disorders.Cancer.Can allergies cause fever?Allergies can cause cold-like symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes, but they typically don’t cause fever. Despite its name, hay fever (also called allergic rhinitis) doesn’t cause fever.Care and TreatmentWhat’s the best way to measure body temperature?You can take your temperature in several different parts of your body. The most common site is your mouth (oral temperature). Other sites include your ear (tympanic membrane), forehead (temporal artery) and armpit (axillary). The most accurate site is the rectum, and the least accurate site is the armpit.The best way to measure your temperature is with a digital thermometer. Glass thermometers contain mercury and providers no longer recommend them.How can I break a fever at home?If your fever is mild — less than 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C) — you usually don’t need treatment with medication. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids and get plenty of rest. Taking a lukewarm bath — about 98 degrees F (36.7 degrees C) — may also help bring your body’s temperature down. Keep an eye on signs of dehydration and other worsening symptoms.If you’re feeling uncomfortable and your temperature is higher than 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C), you can try to break the fever. The most common way to get rid of a fever is to use over-the-counter (OTC) medications such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including ibuprofen, naproxen and aspirin.Don’t give aspirin to children under the age of 17. Aspirin in children may cause Reye’s syndrome, a sometimes fatal illness.Does ibuprofen reduce fever?Yes, you can take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen to try to reduce a fever.How long does a fever last?The cause of the fever determines how long it’ll last. Typically, if an infection is the cause of your fever, it should pass within three to four days. Call your healthcare provider if the fever lingers longer than that or comes along with breathing changes.AdvertisementCare at Cleveland ClinicFind a Primary Care ProviderSchedule an AppointmentWhen To Call the DoctorWhen should a fever be treated by a healthcare provider?In adults, fevers less than 103 degrees F (39.4 degrees C) typically aren’t dangerous and aren’t a cause for concern. If your fever rises above that level, make a call to your healthcare provider for treatment.In children, call your child’s healthcare provider if:Their fever lasts more than five days.Their fever is higher than 104 degrees F (40 degrees C).Medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen don’t break the fever.You’re concerned they aren’t behaving normally.They have any problems breathing or urinating.When should I go to the ER?If you have a fever along with any of the following symptoms, go to your nearest emergency room or call 911. It may be a sign of a serious or life-threatening illness.Pain or tenderness in your belly (abdomen).Nausea or vomiting.Severe headache.Stiff neck.Light irritates your eyes (photophobia).Convulsions or seizures.Difficulty breathing.Strange behavior and/or altered speech.Confusion or irritability.Difficulty waking or extreme sleepiness.Fever rash (small bleeding spots under your skin).When should I take my child to the ER?If your baby has a fever and is under 3 months of age, take them to the ER right away. Your baby’s immune system hasn’t developed fully yet, and they could have a serious infection.AdvertisementIf your child has a fever along with any of the following symptoms, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room:Extreme sluggishness or drowsiness.Lack of appetite.Excessive drooling or difficulty swallowing.Continuous crying.Stiff neck.Fever rash.Difficulty breathing.Severe abdominal pain.Redness or swelling.Dehydration (not drinking many fluids).Decreased urination.What are the possible complications or risks of not treating a fever?Untreated fevers above 105.8 degrees F (41 degrees C) can be dangerous. If your body temperature reaches this level, your organs will begin to malfunction and will eventually fail.Even moderate fevers can be dangerous for adults with lung or heart disorders because fever causes your breathing rate and heart rate to increase. Fever can also worsen the mental state of people with dementia.Additional Common QuestionsWhat is a recurrent fever?A recurrent fever is a fever that keeps coming back multiple times over a period of time. Providers call these fevers episodic because they come and go. The fever lasts for a few days and then goes away for a stretch of time. Your child is healthy and acts normally between fevers. Recurrent fevers affect young children under the age of 5 most often. They’re one of the main symptoms of a collection of conditions called periodic fever syndromes.AdvertisementWhat is a febrile seizure?Some children have a side effect of fevers called febrile seizures. This happens in 2% to 4% of children under the age of 5. Some seizures cause jerking movements, or it may look like your child has passed out. When this happens, put your child on their side and don’t put anything in their mouth. Call 911 if the seizure lasts for more than five minutes and/or your child’s lips turn blue.If the seizure lasts less than five minutes, notify their healthcare provider and get medical attention right away.What is a fever dream?Fever dreams are vivid, bizarre or unpleasant dreams you may experience when your body temperature rises higher than normal. Researchers don’t know the exact cause of fever dreams. But some scientists think fevers cause your brain to “overheat,” affecting your cognitive processing, which results in dreams stranger than your typical dreams. Fevers may also interrupt your REM sleep cycle, which can lead to unusual dreams.A note from Cleveland ClinicWhile a fever can be uncomfortable, it’s typically a sign that your body is working properly and your immune system is kicking into action. You don’t need to treat low fevers, but you can take over-the-counter pain relievers until they pass. If you or your child has a higher temperature or your fever hasn’t passed within a few days, you should make a call to your healthcare provider. While infections most often cause fevers, there could be other underlying conditions you’ll want to get checked out.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed on 05/31/2023.Learn more about the Health Library and our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementAdvertisementAdQuestions 216.444.2538Appointments & LocationsRequest an AppointmentFind a Primary Care ProviderRendered: Thu Jan 30 2025 03:20:07 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)FacebookTwitterYouTubeInstagramLinkedInPinterestSnapchatActionsAppointments & AccessAccepted InsuranceEvents CalendarFinancial AssistanceGive to Cleveland ClinicPay Your Bill OnlineRefer a PatientPhone DirectoryVirtual Second OpinionsVirtual VisitsBlog, News & AppsConsult QDHealth EssentialsNewsroomMyClevelandClinicMyChartAbout Cleveland Clinic100 Years of Cleveland ClinicAbout UsLocationsQuality & Patient SafetyOffice of Diversity & InclusionPatient ExperienceResearch & InnovationsCommunity CommitmentCareersFor EmployeesResources for Medical ProfessionalsSite Information & PoliciesSend Us FeedbackSite MapAbout this WebsiteCopyright, Reprint & LicensingWebsite Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyNotice of Privacy PracticesNon-Discrimination Notice9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 800.223.2273 | © 2025 Cleveland Clinic.
